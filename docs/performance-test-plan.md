# Journal API Performance Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the Journal API, focusing on the two most frequently used endpoints.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. POST /api/journal/{journalId}/entry
Testing creation of new journal entries

#### Test Cases
- Single user creating entries sequentially
- Multiple users creating entries concurrently
- Bulk entry creation simulation

#### Test Parameters
- Virtual Users: 10, 50, 100
- Ramp-up Period: 30 seconds
- Test Duration: 5 minutes
- Think Time: 1-3 seconds between requests
- Payload Size: ~500 bytes (typical journal entry)

#### Success Criteria
- Response Time: P95 < 500ms
- Error Rate: < 1%
- Throughput: > 100 requests/second

### 2. GET /api/journal/{journalId}/entry
Testing retrieval of journal entries within date ranges

#### Test Cases
- Single user querying entries
- Multiple users querying same time ranges
- Queries with varying date ranges (small to large)

#### Test Parameters
- Virtual Users: 20, 100, 200
- Ramp-up Period: 30 seconds
- Test Duration: 5 minutes
- Think Time: 2-5 seconds between requests
- Date Range Variations: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month

#### Success Criteria
- Response Time: P95 < 1000ms
- Error Rate: < 1%
- Throughput: > 200 requests/second

## Test Environment

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Test Environment: Matching production specifications
- Database: MongoDB (matching production config)
- Network: Isolated test network
- Monitoring Tools: JVM metrics, MongoDB metrics

### Test Data
- Pre-populated journals: 100
- Pre-populated entries per journal: 1000
- Data distribution: Entries spread across 12 months

## Test Execution

### Tools
- Apache JMeter for load testing
- Grafana + Prometheus for monitoring
- Custom scripts for data generation

### Test Execution Steps
1. Reset test database to known state
2. Start monitoring tools
3. Execute test scenarios individually
4. Run combined load test
5. Generate performance reports

### Monitoring Metrics
- Response times (min, max, average, P95)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Error rates
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Database connection pool stats
- MongoDB query performance

## Reporting

### Performance Report Contents
1. Executive Summary
2. Test Scenarios Overview
3. Test Results vs Success Criteria
4. Performance Bottlenecks
5. Recommendations

### Performance Metrics to Track
- Average Response Time
- 95th Percentile Response Time
- Maximum Response Time
- Requests per Second
- Error Rate
- System Resource Utilization

## Risk Mitigation
1. Database backup before testing
2. Monitoring system resources
3. Test data isolation
4. Gradual load increase
5. Emergency shutdown procedure
